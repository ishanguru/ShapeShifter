Things to do: 

LLVM side: 
	
	- Convert cpp interface into LLVM IR (do this using clang)
	- Figure out mapping from scene() to main()
	- Figure out what the cpp interface maps to in the LLVM IR file (for starters just hardcode the strings)
	- Map the shape objects to the .off files they correspond to
	- For Shape initialization copy the primitive to the new file that's associated with the new shape name
	- Figure out how to do file cleanup (when the program ends delete the temporary files that were created)
	- Include a random function (random floats between zero and one)
	- Add in support for exceptions (and try/catch) / error handling
	- Support bitwise shifts
	- Include Sine/Cosine
	- Figure out how to get the dot operator working

Graphics side: 

    - Fix the display (some of the shapes show up weirdly; like ballA.off)
    - Find .OFF files for the basic shapes
    - Test all the transformations / operations thoroughly
    - Expand the CorkTriMesh class to have some important info like
        - position (overall shape position; this is pretty important)
        - orientation

Testing side: 

	- Get testing suite working
	- Test case for the AST (does it map correctly to what we expect)
	- Test case for Hello World 
	- Try break the program as much as possible (a lot of negative testing - write test cases)
	- Figure out what are runtime errors vs. compiler errors
	- Test expected shape generation
	- Have atleast 2/3 working tests for the hello world demo
