There are two groups of tests in the ShapeShifter test suite: (1) tests that are supposed to pass and whose filenames are structured as test_*.shift (2) tests that are supposed to fail and whose filenames are structured as fail_*.shift. 

In each of those groups, various aspects of the ShapeShifter language tested systematically. The nature of the test is represented in the filename itself. For example, text_arith_int.shift tests our whether arithmetic operations function properly using only int data types. 


TO IMPLEMENT:
+ fail_arith_mixedtypes.shift
