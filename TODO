Things to do: 

Core functionality: 
- Runtime support for shapes... 
    should fix the whole 'can't pass shapes around, use in loops problem'
- Branching / loops


Nice to have: 
- Make .tmp directory on program start, delete it at the end
- Sine/cosine/rand... particularly rand... 
- Remove the need for int from scene... We don't return anything :(
- Expanded semantic analysis
- Print newlines, negative numbers(?)
- Something about bitwise operators?

Test
- Make large-scale tests. Integration is hard. Note that cork becomes sad
and laggy the more operations you do, and freaks out if you try to put 
shapes together so that they only just barely overlap, so be careful.
