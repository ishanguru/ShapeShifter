This folder contains the graphics and mesh-editing backend for Shapeshifter. 

It uses a (soon-to-be expanded) version of the Cork boolean library for the 
underlying mesh representation and modification. 

For display, OpenGL is used in conjunction with the utility toolkit glut. 

TODO: 
    - Fix the display (some of the shapes show up weirdly; like ballA.off)
    - Find .OFF files for the basic shapes
    - Test all the transformations / operations thoroughly
    - Expand the CorkTriMesh class to have some important info like
        - position (overall shape position; this is pretty important)
        - orientation
